1. Difficulty in Finding Debian 12 ISO

During the initial setup, most official and third-party links redirected to Debian 13.3, which is not compatible with the FreePBX 17 installation script.

Debian 12 ISO was difficult to locate from common download sources.

This caused delays in the setup process.

Resolution:
After extended searching, the official Debian archive repository was used to download Debian 12.
The OS was then installed manually inside the virtual machine.

2. Debian Installation on Virtual Machine

Initial installation attempts failed due to incorrect ISO versions.

Network and storage settings in VirtualBox were misconfigured.

Guest OS tools were not properly installed, affecting performance.

Resolution:
Configured correct VM settings and successfully installed Debian 12 before proceeding with FreePBX installation.

3. Network & VM Connectivity Issues

IP address changed between 10.0.2.x (NAT) and 192.168.x.x (Bridged mode).

This caused accessibility issues between host and VM.

FreePBX web interface was not reachable initially.

Resolution:
Changed network mode to Bridged Adapter and added the host network to the trusted firewall zone.

4. SIP Client (Zoiper) Registration Failures

Zoiper showed 408 Request Timeout errors.

Extensions failed to register initially.

SIP traffic was blocked by firewall rules.

Resolution:
Configured firewall permissions and verified registration using pjsip show endpoints.

5. FreePBX Web Interface Errors

Frequent AJAX and server response errors occurred.

Web interface sometimes stopped responding after applying configuration.

Resolution:
Restarted Apache and Asterisk services and corrected permission issues.

6. Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI) Authentication Issues

AMI login initially failed with authentication errors.

Configuration files were overwritten by FreePBX.

Duplicate user entries caused conflicts.

Resolution:
Configured AMI using FreePBX-supported files and verified using Telnet.

7. Asterisk REST Interface (ARI) Configuration Problems

ARI user added manually was not detected.

ari show users did not reflect configuration changes.

“Authentication required” error persisted.

Resolution:
Configured ARI via FreePBX interface and restarted services.
